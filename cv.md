## Briefly About Myself:

I am a creative designer and developer with a rich background in crafting unique and innovative projects. My journey began in the field of interior design, where I developed and implemented design projects in various styles, including loft, Scandinavian, and fusion.

My passion for architectural models led me to work in a production workshop, where I supervised the entire production cycle of architectural models, created 3D models, and designed intricate details. My experience also includes collaborating with leading architectural studios, where I crafted models and technical designs.

To enhance my skills, I pursued training in various schools, including game development courses on Unreal Engine 4 and 3D graphics and animation training in Blender. These courses gave me confidence in using technological tools and allowed me to unleash my creative potential.

Currently, I specialize in creating 3D and 2D plans for homes and apartments based on photographs. However, my passion for technology and my desire for continuous growth led me to the decision to become a front-end developer. I am confident that this field will provide me with numerous opportunities for learning and development, and I am prepared to contribute my expertise to your company. My design experience and technical skills make me a valuable professional, ready to tackle creative challenges and embark on new projects.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can benefit your company and contribute to the advancement of your projects. Thank you for your attention!
